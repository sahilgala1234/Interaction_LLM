### User Interaction Logger
This module captures detailed interactions of all visitor actions on the site, including clicks, hovers, touches, typing, swipes, and scrolls, specifically noting the exact locations and timings of these actions. It uses this data to construct a narrative, n, which, for simplicity can serve as N the summary of the visitor's identified needs based on their interactions. The module assesses its effectiveness by how accurately it can model these interactions and generate a narrative that reflects the visitor's interests and needs.
